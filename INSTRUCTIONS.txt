STEPS

1. Replace 'default_work_dir' with your appropriate baseline MESA directory.
   The example here uses the 3M model input physics from Fields et al. 2016.
   The 'rates_tables/rates_list.txt' MUST list the rate(s) you wish to sample 
   and the text file containing your to be generated sampled rate.

2. Provide the raw STARLIB rate data for the rates in your scheme and place
   in 'starlib_raw_rates' with naming following MESA nomenclature. Include a 
   'rates_list.txt' file using the format from 'mesa/data/rates_data/rates_tables'.

3. Execute reac_samp.make_dirs(n),reac_samp.make_var_rates(n) where 'n' is the 
   number of samples in your scheme. 

OUTPUT

'rate_varitation_factors.txt' the random numbers used for the i'th sampled model.

- The first column is the number of the rate used in your scheme, 0->M for M sampled         
  rates.

- The second column is the random number that is used to generate the i'th sample for the M'th reaction.

'example_grid/' grid of monte carlo stellar models each with a set of 'rate_tables' containing sampled rates to be read by MESA for each individual run.
